###### Development For:

UCLA Extension's & U2 Network Boot Camp's
Full-Stack Web Development Coding Boot Camp 2021-2022

### Project Description:

###### *Fictional Story:*

- Run Buddy is a company that matches runners with personal trainers.
- I was tasked to create a landing page for the website as a freelancer that was hired by a friend at Run Buddy.
- A website service that lets runners sign up for personal training.
- Create a landing page is to attact more sign-ups as a new hired Full-Stack Developer that will hand off this site to internal developers to complete the data collection.
- Set up a basic structured semantic HTML & CSS document.
- The Run Buddy website is a huge success so far!
- With the landing page bringing in more business, the company now has the capital and incentive to upgrade the site.
- So this week we'll focus on building Run Buddy 2.0, which will make the site mobile-friendly and easier to use.
- In doing so, we'll intergrade more depth powerful layout capabilities of CSS, including media queries and flexbox.
- Building a foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Git involves a steep learning curve. Learning a myriad of concepts and complex, intertwined tools all at once.
